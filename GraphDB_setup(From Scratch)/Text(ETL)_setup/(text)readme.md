# **Text Extraction and Chunking Scripts**

This repository contains two Python scripts for extracting text from a PDF file and splitting the extracted text into smaller chunks with overlap. These scripts are useful for preprocessing text data for tasks like natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, or storing in a database.

---

## **Scripts Overview**

### **1. `extract_text.py`**
- **Purpose**: Extracts text from a single PDF file (`iSmartTrends.pdf`) and saves the extracted text as a `.txt` file.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `PyMuPDF` (`fitz`): A Python library for working with PDF files.
- **Usage**:
   - Upload "inSisHelpFiles" folder here. 
   - Place the `iSmartTrends.pdf` file in the `SmartTrend` folder (or update the `pdf_folder` variable to point to your folder).
  - Run the script to extract text and save it in the `extracted_text` folder.

### **2. `chunkedText.py`**
- **Purpose**: Splits the extracted text into smaller chunks with a specified chunk size and overlap.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `langchain`: A Python library for text processing (specifically, the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`).
- **Usage**:
  - Ensure the `extracted_text` folder contains the text file generated by `extract_text.py`.
  - Run the script to split the text into chunks and save them in the `chunked_text` folder.

---

## **Requirements**
1. **Python 3.7+**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install pymupdf langchain
     ```

## **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Extract Text from PDF**
1. **Place the PDF File**:
   

2. **Run the Script**:
 

3. **Output**:
   - The extracted

### **Step 2: Chunk Extracted Text**
1. **Ensure Extracted Text File Exists**:
 
2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the `chunkedText.py` script:
     ```bash
     python chunkedText.py
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - The chunked text will be saved in the `chunked_text` folder.

## **Script Details**

### **`extract_text.py`**
- **Functions**:
  - `extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)`: Extracts text from a single PDF file.
  - `extract_text_from_folder(folder_path, output_folder)`: Extracts text from the PDF file in the folder and saves it as a `.txt` file.
- **Variables**:
  - `pdf_folder`: Path to the folder containing the PDF file 
  - `output_folder`: Path to the folder where the extracted text file will be saved (default: `extracted_text`).

### **`chunkedText.py`**
- **Functions**:
  - `read_text_file(file_path)`: Reads text from a `.txt` file.
  - `chunk_text(text, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)`: Splits text into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
- **Variables**:
  - `text_folder`: Path to the folder containing the extracted text file (default: `extracted_text`).
  - `chunked_folder`: Path to the folder where chunked text files will be saved (default: `chunked_text`).
  - `chunk_size`: Size of each chunk in characters (default: `1024`).
  - `chunk_overlap`: Overlap between chunks in characters (default: `50`).

## **Example Workflow**

### **Input**
place the file
  ```

### **Step 1: Extract Text**
- Run `extract_text.py`:
  ```bash
  python extract_text.py
  ```
- Output in `extracted_text` folder:
  ```
  extracted_text/
  └─
  ```

### **Step 2: Chunk Text**
- Run `chunkedText.py`:
  ```bash
  python chunkedText.py
  ```
- Output in `chunked_text` folder:
  ```
  chunked_text/
  ├── 
  └── ...  # Additional chunks
  ```

---

## **Customization**
- **Chunk Size and Overlap**:
  - Modify the `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` variables in `chunkedText.py` to suit your needs.

- **Input/Output Folders**:
  - Update the `pdf_folder`, `output_folder`, `text_folder`, and `chunked_folder` variables in the scripts to use custom folder paths.

---

## **Troubleshooting**
1. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed:
     ```bash
     pip install pymupdf langchain
     ```

2. **File Not Found**:
   - Ensure the input folders exist and contain the required files.

3. **Permission Issues**:
   - Ensure you have read/write permissions for the input and output folders.
